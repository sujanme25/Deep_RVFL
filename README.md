# Deep_RVFL

Deep Random Vector Functional Link (Deep RVFL) is an extension of the Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) neural network model. RVFL is a type of neural network designed for regression and classification tasks. It is a single-layer feedforward network with a single hidden layer of random weights and biases.

Here are some key features of the RVFL model:

Input Layer: The input layer of an RVFL network simply passes the input features to the hidden layer.

Hidden Layer: The hidden layer of an RVFL network consists of randomly generated weights and biases. The weights and biases are assigned randomly and remain fixed during training. This layer is responsible for transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space.

Output Layer: The output layer is a linear layer that computes the output based on the transformed features from the hidden layer. For regression tasks, this layer outputs a continuous value, while for classification tasks, it can use softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Training Procedure: RVFL networks are trained using a simple and fast training procedure. The output layer weights are computed using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the hidden layer outputs. This makes RVFL networks computationally efficient and suitable for large datasets.

Deep RVFL extends the RVFL architecture by introducing multiple hidden layers, allowing for the creation of deeper networks. Each hidden layer in a deep RVFL network operates similarly to the hidden layer in a traditional RVFL network, with randomly generated weights and biases.

The deep architecture allows for more complex feature representations and hierarchical learning. However, the training procedure remains efficient due to the pseudoinverse-based weight computation.

Deep RVFL networks are often used in applications where a fast training procedure is desirable, such as regression and classification tasks in domains like finance, image processing, and signal processing. They are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and when computational efficiency is a priority.
